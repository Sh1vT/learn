## What is the repo all about?

Learn is a simple learning app built using Flutter for kids. This app is designed to provide an engaging learning experience for children, covering a wide range of topics including:

- *A-Z Alphabets* with examples and pronunciation.
- *Animals* and their pronunciation along with their voices.
- *Body parts* and their pronunciation with short information on various topics.
- More exciting features are planned for future updates, such as birds and their voices, information on the solar system, knowledge of shapes, and much more!

## What is the solution trying to solve?

For children aged 2-5 years old, the app addresses the need for basic knowledge of their surroundings. Teachers often have to search for images and information individually, but this app provides a single, comprehensive resource where all images and categories are available in one place. Categories include:

- A-Z
- Birds
- Body parts
- Shapes
- Solar system
- Animals

In addition to learning, the app offers quizzes and a speaking feature to help children learn how to pronounce various objects.
